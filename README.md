# EMG‚ÄìFMG Gesture Recognition

Proof of Concept ¬∑ Capstone Project (BSc in Biomedical Engineering)

Integration of electromyography (EMG) and force myography (FMG) signals for low-cost prosthetic hand control.  
Developed by Nuno Louren√ßo Pires ‚Äî supervised by Milton P. Macedo, PhD (University of Coimbra).

----
Overview  
This repository presents a proof-of-concept system combining EMG and FMG signals from forearm muscle groups to recognize hand gestures for prosthetic control.  
The work validates the feasibility of a low-cost bimodal biosignal interface using BITalino and FSR-402 sensors, implemented in MATLAB.

Features  
- Acquisition of synchronized EMG and FMG signals  
- Signal conditioning circuit (LM358 amplifier)  
- MATLAB-based preprocessing and classification pipeline  
- Evaluation across 30+ classifiers (Quadratic SVM ‚âà 88% accuracy)  
- Open documentation (report and peer-reviewed Signals paper)

Results  
- Best model: Quadratic SVM (~88% accuracy)  
- ~13 pp improvement over EMG-only  
- Dataset: 5 gestures √ó 3 subjects √ó multiple repetitions
